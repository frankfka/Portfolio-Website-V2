      As a fitness enthusiast and stickler for healthy eating, I wanted to easily access
      nutritional information of restaurant menu items. However, I could not find an existing
      solution that integrated nutritional details of a variety of restaurants. I have always
      had an interest in developing mobile applications, so I decided to build this app myself.

    <p>
      Unfortunately, I had no experience nor knowledge in mobile application development. I
      decided to
      <span class="accent-text">self-enroll in a Udemy course for iOS development</span>. This
      project was not only an excellent introduction into the realm of mobile software, but also
      allowed me to experiment in <span class="accent-text">web crawling, data processing, and SQLite databases.</span>
